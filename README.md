# Homework for QA GURU Python lesson 8

Task:
Implement and test classes for an online store. 
All the places that need to be completed, both in the tests and the classes, are marked with # TODO.
When implementing, pay attention to the typing of method arguments and return values. Also, pay attention to the organization of tests in the test file:
- Tests are grouped by the class they are testing.
- Each test is named after the corresponding method.
You can start with either implementing the classes or the tests.
